This is a collection of modules that are for dealing with Debian related
data. Each module is documented with it's own README file, or some examples.

Currently supported are

  * Debtags data with debtags.py
  * Debian changelogs with changelog.py

If you have a module that is for manipulation or interrogation of Debian 
specific data then consider adding it to this package. You can discuss it with 
the maintainers by contacting
