python-debian (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * debian_support.py
    - Support ~ in version numbers when python-apt is not installed.
  * Turn on the testsuites of changelog.py, and debtags.py in the build.
  * debtags.py
    - Rename with to with_ to avoid a warning on python2.5 as with will be
      a keyword in 2.6. (Closes: #409333)
  * Suggest python-apt and mention why in the README.

  [Reinhard Tartler]
  * Fix the regex matching the end line of a debian/changelog. Using
    improved regex contributed by Francois-Denis Gonthier, thanks!
    (Closes: #410880)
  * disable python_support.py testrun, it is missing in the branch.
  * add myself to uploaders.

python-debian (0.1.1) unstable;  urgency=low

  [ John Wright ]
  * changelog.py:
    - Version class:
      + Subclass debian_support.Version, for rich comparison
      + Changing any attribute now automatically updates any other affected
        attribute (i.e. changing full_version will update all of the other
        attributes; changing debian_version will update full_version)
    - Changelog class:
      + Many "getter" and "setter" methods were replaced with properties (so
        they appear as regular object attributes).  Most set_* methods remain
        for compatibility, and they're the actual set methods for the
        properties anyway.  Please see README.changelog.
      + You can now assign a string to the version attribute, and it will be
        coerced into a Version object

  [ James Westby ]
  * changelog.py:
    - Added a method to write the changelog to an open file.
    - Allow single digit day with no extra space in the endline of a
      changelog. Hopefully this wont allow things to be parsed that will
      be rejected by the more important tools. It does allow more files
      to be parsed and used, and I'm not entirely sure what is right.
    - Allow uppercase characters in the version number when parsing
      changelogs. Thanks to Jelmer Vernooij for the report and the fix.
  * README.changelog:
    - Update the documentation to reflect the changes mentioned above
  * Add debian/NEWS to warn of the API changes.

  [ Enrico Zini ]
  * debtags.py:
    - Added various methods after the work on the inferrer of tag
      relationships
    - Added tagminer and pkgwalk examples
