gnutls13 (1:1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Remove the following patches as they are now included upstream:
    - 10_certtoolmanpage.diff
    - 15_fixcompilewarning.diff
    - 30_man_hyphen_*.patch
  * Link the API reference in /usr/share/gtk-doc/html as gnutls rather than
    gnutls-api so that devhelp can find it.
